# APOLLO

Methylation profiling of glioma has become an integral part of the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. However, determining the methylation subtype of glioma in a fast manner that would make it suitable for intraoperative decision-making remains a challenge. Herein we developed a novel workflow which we call APOLLO, based on spontaneous Raman spectroscopy and machine learning, to predict the methylation subtype of gliomas using FFPE slides. We demonstrate that our workflow discriminates tumors from non-tumor areas with a high accuracy of 0.98. We also show that APOLLO can discriminate IDH1mut versus IDH1WT tumors with accuracy 0.78. Moreover, we achieved high discriminatory power between G-CIMP-high and G-CIMP-low molecular phenotypes with accuracy 0.75, both of which are lower-grade IDH1mut gliomas but display vastly different clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we identified novel Raman shifts that are important for discriminating between different methylation subtypes and validated them using stimulated Raman spectroscopy and immunohistochemistry. We uncovered novel metabolic signatures of IDH1mut glioma that set them apart from IDH1WT due to their unique lipid biology. The development of APOLLO allows fast, reliable, and accurate prediction of methylation subtypes of glioma which can be implemented in the Operating Room.
